# **Game Design Document: "Blobberman"**
*A massively multiplayer, paint-splashing twist on the classic Bomberman formula.*

---

## **1. Game Overview**

**Title:** Blobberman
**Genre:** Multiplayer Action, Competitive Arena, .io-style
**Platform:** Web (Three.js), PC, Mobile
**Players:** Massively Multiplayer (dozens to hundreds in one arena)
**Core Mechanic:** Drop paint bombs to eliminate players, break obstacles, and paint the most ground before time runs out.
**Visual Style:** Cute, colorful, and smooth "squircle" art style with **3D rendering** at a **top-down/slightly isometric** angle.

---

## **2. Core Gameplay Mechanics**

### **2.1 Player Movement**
- The game **simulates movement in a 2D grid** but **renders in 3D** with a **top-down, slightly isometric perspective**.
- Movement is **tile-based but smooth** (not locked to grid).
- Players can move **in four directions** (up, down, left, right).
- Players can’t pass through solid walls but can move through painted areas.

### **2.2 Paint Bombs**
- Players drop **small paint bombs** that **explode in a cross pattern** (up, down, left, right).
- The **explosion stops at the first obstacle or player** it hits.
- The explosion **paints the ground** in the player’s color.
- The bomb **destroys the first breakable wall** it contacts.
- Any player hit by the explosion **loses all their painted area and power-ups** but is not eliminated.

### **2.3 Painting and Scoring**
- The **goal** is to **paint the most ground** with your color before the match ends.
- Areas already painted by another player **can be overwritten** by a new explosion.
- If a player gets hit by an explosion, they **lose all their painted territory** (it resets to neutral).
- At the end of the match, the player **with the most painted tiles wins**.
- A **real-time leaderboard** updates during gameplay.

### **2.4 Obstacles and Walls**
- **Breakable Walls:** Destroyed by paint bombs, revealing **new paths**.
- **Unbreakable Walls:** Cannot be destroyed and serve as permanent barriers.
- **Power-Up Blocks:** Some walls hide **power-ups** when destroyed.

---

## **3. Game Flow**

### **3.1 Match Start**
- Players **spawn at random locations** on the map.
- A **countdown** begins before the match starts.

### **3.2 During the Match**
- Players drop **paint bombs** to **paint the arena**, **break walls**, and **eliminate opponents' progress**.
- Players who get hit by a bomb **lose all their painted area and power-ups** but remain in the game.
- The **map constantly changes** as walls are destroyed and areas are repainted.
- A timer **counts down** the match duration (e.g., 3-5 minutes).

### **3.3 End of Match**
- When the timer reaches **0**, the match **ends**.
- The player with the **most painted tiles** **wins**.
- A results screen **shows rankings**, total paint coverage, and other stats.

---

## **4. Power-Ups & Upgrades**
Power-ups are hidden in **breakable walls** and provide **temporary or permanent effects**. However, power-ups can also be **destroyed if hit by paint** before a player collects them. Additionally, when a player gets hit by a splat, they **lose all their power-ups**.

### **4.1 Standard Power-Ups**
- **Extra Paint Bombs** → Increases the number of bombs a player can drop at once.
- **Longer Paint Splat** → Extends the explosion radius of paint bombs.
- **Speed Boost** → Temporarily increases movement speed.
- **Splat Shield** → Prevents losing territory and power-ups when hit (temporary).
- **Splash Jump** → Allows a short jump over one tile.

### **4.2 Debuff Power-Ups** (Negative Effects)
Some power-ups are actually **debuffs** and can make gameplay more challenging:
- **Shorter Fuse** → Bombs explode faster, making timing more difficult.
- **Paint Drain** → Temporarily reduces the amount of ground a bomb paints.
- **Sticky Feet** → Slows the player's movement speed.

---

## **5. Multiplayer & Networking**

### **5.1 Matchmaking**
- Players enter a **shared arena** with **many others** (like .io games).
- **Matches are continuous**, meaning players can **join mid-match** without waiting.
- New players **spawn in empty areas** to avoid instant eliminations.

### **5.2 Player Interaction**
- Players can **bump into each other**, slightly pushing opponents.
- Players can see **real-time leaderboard rankings**.

---

## **6. Level Design**

### **6.1 Map Size & Layout**
- Levels are **much larger than Bomberman** to support **dozens or hundreds of players**.
- The map has **a mix of open areas, maze-like sections, and power-up zones**.
- Some maps have **moving obstacles** or **environmental hazards**.

### **6.2 Dynamic Level Changes**
- Players **gradually reshape the level** by breaking walls.
- Some areas may **change over time**, introducing **new paths and barriers**.

---

## **7. Art & Aesthetics**

### **7.1 Visual Style**
- **Colorful, cartoony, and vibrant** with a **"squircle" (soft, rounded shapes) art style**.
- Players are **squishy blob-like characters** with unique colors.
- The game is **rendered in 3D**, but **simulated as a 2D grid**, viewed from a **top-down/slightly isometric angle**.
- Explosions create **paint splats** with a **satisfying, fluid look**.

### **7.2 Paint Physics**
- Paint spreads with **smooth splat effects**.
- The ground gets **progressively messier** as players fight for coverage.

---

## **8. Sound & Music**
- **Upbeat, fast-paced music** to match the intensity.
- **Satisfying "splat" sound effects** for explosions.
- **Subtle background sounds** (crowds cheering, distant paint splats).

---

## **10. Conclusion**
**Blobberman** is a fast-paced, **massively multiplayer competitive game** where players **battle for paint dominance**. Instead of eliminations, players must **protect their painted area**, making strategy and positioning key to victory.

With its **cute, rounded "squircle" aesthetic**, **3D rendering with a slightly isometric perspective**, and **chaotic multiplayer gameplay**, the game creates a fresh, fun take on the Bomberman-style formula.

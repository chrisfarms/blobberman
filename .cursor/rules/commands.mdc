# Executing Commands

- NEVER execute commands that start web servers, backends, or development server, instead simply mention how to start it.
- It is important to not attempt to run commands like pnpm dev, pnpm start, npm run dev etc as they are likely already running elsewhere.
- You never execute git commands unless directly prompted to.
- You must not execute "go run cmd/server.go" commands, ask the user to do it
